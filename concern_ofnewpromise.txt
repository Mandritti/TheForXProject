The concern of that 'might', is that lie which can corrupt.
Who might play games, with that disguising, that hiding, that occluding?  Playing games with CLARITY, as the TRUTH is only there and in the "WILLING ILLUSIONS"?

echo -> A great deal can be given if it is made of nothing.  But 'Ex nihilo, nihil fit'; more crucial than knowing that line, is knowing the full cost of taking on something that turns out to be a lie.  For we SHOULD NOT GAMBLE WITH A LIFE, yet perhaps we must gamble with some so as not with others.

Perhaps.  Might.

A lie can corrupt everything.

 But, 
echo -> we might explain the role of ignorance, forgetting, distraction, occlusion, information-hiding, and termination, in the terms of all of these things as instances of information-hiding, ignorance, forgetting, occlusion, and volitional termination.  Which holds the promise of one step beyond the summary, of knowing the mind of IT THAT DISGUISES ~beneficently~.
