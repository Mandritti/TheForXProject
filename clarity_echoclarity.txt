Clarity begets truth as I can imagine no other.
<Promise_Clarity branch>:... clarity is the permission OF the truth, despite the confounds, of OUR VERY BEING, in that place at that time, and, of course, in our diseased and worn-out bodies.  BY MEANS ONLY OF sound, air, heat, light, and the fiction that words can be true (cf. truth_ofpromise.txt), and all the other accoutrements of this BODY, fallen amidst this world, we PROMISE that truth and permit it by WILLING ILLUSIONS.
