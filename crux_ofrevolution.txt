Clarity gives focus upon (what can be said?) the communication that PERFORMS our honest thoughts.  To this we lend great weight, gravity, care, attention, and love, because it begets that truth *and we must* see it to its conclusion or meet a failure to obtain that prize; (cont'd)
Clarity begets truth as I can imagine no other.
... clarity is the permission OF the truth, despite the confounds, of OUR VERY BEING, in that place at that time, and, of course, in our diseased and worn-out bodies.  BY MEANS ONLY OF sound, air, heat, light, and the fiction that words can be true (cf. truth_ofpromise.txt), and all the other accoutrements of this BODY, fallen amidst this world, we PROMISE that truth and permit it by WILLING ILLUSIONS.
In this way (cf. promise_echotriviality.txt), every worth of language ever obtained by Mankind has been a WILLING ILLUSION , on the part of the listener, and perhaps the utterer.

ILLUSION makes Truth utterable.

The word is illusion, the sound is truth.  All utterance is illusion.  More critically, all OUR VERY BEING, made of this matter, is ILLUSION once we think we have it BY MEANS OF a word.

So, for what reason would a beneficent force, use illusion? information-hiding? self-deception? or death?
