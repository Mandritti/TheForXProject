Truth is something more complex than our philosophy has dreamt of.  It is a mistake to say that any sentence, any utterance, is true, or qualifies for truth.  Statements are what they are: a stating.  Sounds.  To see a proposition (=a truth-valued object) in the utterance, is to put a parcel of the mind into the -real- fact: just the utterance and sound, the light, the apparition.
