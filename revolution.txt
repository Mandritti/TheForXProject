We must be willing to consider evidence as it truly exists, if even we do use the vaunted scientific method to verify new postulates.
The use of a scientifically valid tool, appropriate to this desired leap of logic, is in fact at hand.  The nature of plausibility is well-explicated (cf. John Vervaeke) as a commensurety of convergence with promise.  A formula, a frame, a theory that is suggested by many lines of support, is believable, but also reduced to triviality - and triviality is an issue (cont'd), without the feed-out of profound promise from the formula, frame, or theory.
